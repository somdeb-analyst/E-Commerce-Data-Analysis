## 🗃️ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes records of customer orders placed through an online store. Each row contains information such as:
- Order ID, Product, Category
- Customer location
- Order date & ship date
- Sales, profit, discount, shipping cost
- Order priority, region, segment

## ✅ Key Analysis Performed

- Data cleaning and type conversions
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Grouped aggregation (sales by region/category)
- Time-series analysis of monthly revenue
- Shipping delay vs. profit analysis
- Customer segmentation and top-buyer identification
- Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib

---

## 📊 Visual Insights

- Heatmaps showing region-wise sales and profit
- Bar charts of most profitable product categories
- Time plots of order volume and revenue trends
- Boxplots comparing shipping delays by region
- Pie chart of order segments and priority distribution
